## üí° Overview & Mission

This repository is a public log of my **#100DaysOfCode** challenge, focusing exclusively on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implemented in **Java**. My mission is to:

* **Deepen Foundational Knowledge:** Build a rock-solid understanding of core DSA principles.
* **Master Problem Solving:** Develop robust algorithmic thinking and efficient coding solutions.
* **Create Educational Content:** Provide clear, concise, and well-explained notes and solutions to help other learners.
* **Showcase My Skills:** Build a visible portfolio for **Software Development Internship** opportunities.
* **Engage with the Community:** Connect with fellow developers, seek feedback, and contribute to collaborative learning.

This repo covers everything from basic Java constructs to complex algorithmic paradigms, including detailed **LeetCode Problem Solutions** with explanations and dry runs.

### Regarding your question: "Should I create LinkedIn now or later when I have enough to showcase?"

**My strong recommendation is to create your LinkedIn profile NOW.**

Here's why, even if you feel you don't have "enough" to showcase yet:

1.  **It's a Living Document, Not a Final Product:** Your LinkedIn profile isn't a static resume; it's a dynamic professional journey. It's perfectly normal for a student's profile to be "under construction." The goal is to show *progress* and *potential*.
2.  **Early Networking is Key:** LinkedIn is primarily a networking platform. The sooner you start connecting with peers, professors, alumni from your college, and professionals in your desired field, the larger and more valuable your network will become over time. These connections can lead to opportunities (internships, jobs, mentorship) that you might never find through job boards alone.
3.  **Recruiters are Constantly Sourcing:** Many recruiters use LinkedIn to proactively search for talent, even for entry-level and intern roles. They don't just wait for applications; they *find* candidates. An early presence means you're discoverable.
4.  **Showcase Your Learning Journey:** Your #100DaysOfCode challenge is *exactly* the kind of thing you should be showcasing on LinkedIn. You can post updates about your progress, share your GitHub repo, talk about concepts you're learning, and even your thoughts on specific problems. This demonstrates proactivity and passion.
5.  **Professional Online Presence:** In today's world, companies will often search for you online. Having a professional LinkedIn profile provides a positive first impression, showcasing your dedication to your career.
6.  **Learn and Observe:** Even if you're not actively applying, you can use LinkedIn to follow companies you admire, learn about industry trends, and see what skills are in demand.

**What you can put on your LinkedIn profile right now:**

* **Education:** Your current university/college and degree.
* **Skills:** Relevant technical skills (Java, DSA, Git, specific IDEs) and soft skills (problem-solving, continuous learning, communication).
* **About Section:** A brief summary of your career aspirations and your commitment to learning (e.g., "Aspiring Software Developer passionate about problem-solving. Currently undertaking the #100DaysOfCode DSA Challenge in Java to build a strong foundation for future internship roles.").
* **Projects:** **Your `Java-DSA-100Days-Challenge` repository is a major project!** You can add it to your projects section with a description, link, and even a small screenshot of your `README.md`.
* **Volunteer Experience/Extracurriculars:** Any non-academic activities that demonstrate teamwork, leadership, or dedication.

So, go ahead and create that LinkedIn profile! You can start small, and it will grow and evolve as you do. When you're ready, we can update your `README.md` to include your LinkedIn badge and link again.
