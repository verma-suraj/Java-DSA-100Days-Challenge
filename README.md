## 📁 Folder Structure

This repository is organized into 100 folders, one for each day of the challenge.

### Folder Naming

- Folders follow the format: `Day 01`, `Day 02`, ..., `Day 100`
- This keeps everything chronological and easy to browse.

### What's inside each Day folder?

| File / Folder           | Purpose                                               |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `.java` files           | Solutions and practice problems for the day's topic   |
| `notes.md`              | Short summary of key takeaways and learnings          |
| `dryrun.png`            | Visual explanation (hand-drawn or tool-made image)    |
| `Practice_Problems/`    | Folder containing practice problem Java files         |

> This structure helps me stay consistent, and makes it easy for others to learn from or review my work.
