# Day 01: Input and Output

## Topics Covered:
- Using `Scanner` for input in Java
- `System.out.print` and `System.out.println` for output
- Reading `String` and integer inputs

## Key Points:
- Always close the Scanner object to avoid resource leaks.
- Use `nextLine()` to read a whole line of text.
- Use `nextInt()` for integer inputs.

## Struggles:
- Remembering the difference between `next()` and `nextLine()`.
- Handling input buffer issues when switching between reading different types.

## Next Steps:
- Practice more input/output problems.
- Understand exception handling for invalid inputs.
