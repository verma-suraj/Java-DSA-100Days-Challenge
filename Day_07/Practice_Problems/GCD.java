/*
üìå Problem:
Calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers entered by the user using the Euclidean algorithm.

üß† Logic:
- Read two integers from the user.
- Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:
  - While second number (b) is not zero:
    - Store b in a temp variable.
    - Update b to a % b.
    - Update a to temp.
  - When b becomes zero, a holds the GCD.
- Print the GCD.

‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases:
- Negative numbers are not explicitly handled (can cause unexpected behavior).
- Very large inputs may cause integer overflow or input mismatch exceptions.
- No validation if inputs are integers.
- Zero input handled gracefully by Euclidean algorithm (GCD with 0 is the other number).
