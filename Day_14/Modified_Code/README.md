# 🛠️ Modified Code for Visualization – Recursion

This folder contains **modified versions** of the original Java files used in `/Practice_Problems/`, tailored specifically to run on:

🔗 [PythonTutor Java Visualizer](https://pythontutor.com/java.html#mode=edit)

---

## 📌 Why This Folder?

PythonTutor is a great tool for visualizing recursion and memory (stack) behavior, but:
- It doesn't support complex class structures or `Scanner` input
- It requires a simple `main` method and straightforward function calls

So, we’ve created **clean, minimal versions** of the original code here that can be directly pasted into the visualizer.

---

## 📋 File Structure

For each original Java file from `/Practice_Problems/`, you'll find a corresponding file here with the **same filename**.

| Original File                          | Visualizer-Ready File            |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `/Practice_Problems/Factorial.java`    | `/Modified_Code/Factorial.java` |
| `/Practice_Problems/Subsequence.java`  | `/Modified_Code/Subsequence.java` |
| ...                                    | ...                              |

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open [PythonTutor Java Mode](https://pythontutor.com/java.html#mode=edit)
2. Copy the content from any `.java` file in this folder
3. Paste it into the editor
4. Click **"Visualize Execution"**
5. Use step-by-step controls to see how recursion builds and unwinds in memory

---

## 📁 Example Files Included

- `Factorial.java`
- `Subsequence.java`
- `Fibonacci.java`
- `SumOfN.java`

> More will be added as new recursive problems are solved.

## 📌 Tip

To understand stack traces or logic better, refer back to our dry-run format in the main [notes.md](../notes.md).

Happy visualizing! 🧠📊
